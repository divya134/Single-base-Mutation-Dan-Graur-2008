Introduction:
Single nucleotide mutations are classifed into two major types. They are synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. Synonymous mutations
are single nucleotide changes that wont change the amino acid in the protein sequence. Non-synonymous mutations are single nucleotide 
changes which result in changing the amino acid in the protein sequence. It is classified into missense and non-sense mutations.

If single nucleotide change results in a codon which codes for different amino acid, it is called missense mutation.
If single nucleotide change results in a stop codon, it is called non-sense mutation. Single nucleotide mutations are of evolutionary 
importance and medical importance (disease condition).

The script is developed to classify the possibilites of single nucelotide changes in the codons from standard codon table based on their 
effects (type of mutations).

Input: You need a file containing codons along with their respective amino acids.
